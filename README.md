## About

Proof of Concept for a Web API made with [.NET 8](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/whats-new/dotnet-8) (LTS) and [ASP.NET Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/release-notes/aspnetcore-8.0?view=aspnetcore-8.0).

## Structure

## Start

```console
dotnet watch run --project src/Dotnet.Samples.AspNetCore.WebApi/Dotnet.Samples.AspNetCore.WebApi.csproj
```

## Documentation (Development-only)

## Container

### Docker Compose

This setup uses [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to build and run the app and manage a persistent SQLite database stored in a Docker volume.

#### Build the image

```bash
docker compose build
```

#### Start the app

```bash
docker compose up
```

> On first run, the container copies a pre-seeded SQLite database into a persistent volume
> On subsequent runs, that volume is reused and the data is preserved

#### Stop the app

```bash
docker compose down
```

#### Optional: database reset

```bash
docker compose down -v
```

> This removes the volume and will reinitialize the database from the built-in seed file the next time you `up`.

## Credits

The solution has been coded using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [C# Dev Kit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csdevkit) extension.
