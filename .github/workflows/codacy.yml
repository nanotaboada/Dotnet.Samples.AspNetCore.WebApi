# This workflow uses actions not certified by GitHub. They are provided by a
# third-party and governed by separate terms of service, privacy policy, and
# support documentation. This workflow checks out code, performs a Codacy
# security scan, and integrates the results with GitHub Advanced Security code
# scanning feature. For more info on the Codacy Security Scan action usage and
# parameters, see: https://github.com/codacy/codacy-analysis-cli-action.
